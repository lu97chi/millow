# Key Conventions
## URL & State Management:

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management to ensure URL state remains consistent and manageable.

## Component and Data Fetching Strategies:

### Limit use client:
- Use use client sparingly and only for small components requiring direct Web API access.
- Favor server-side components and Next.js SSR for data fetching and state management.

## Follow Documentation:
- Adhere to Next.js best practices for data fetching, rendering, and routing by following official documentation and community guidelines.

## Project Directory Structure:

- Place both /app and /components directories under a /src folder for:
- Clean Organization: A clear separation between application logic and UI components.
- Scalability: Easier navigation, maintenance, and modularity as the project grows.
- Separation of Concerns: Distinct areas for business logic (/src/app) and presentation logic (/src/components).
