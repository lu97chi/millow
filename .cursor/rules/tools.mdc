# Dependency Management & Tools

## Package Manager:

- Use pnpm consistently for installing and managing dependencies to leverage performance benefits and reliable package resolution.

## Tooling:

- Integrate ESLint with TypeScript and React plugins to enforce coding standards.
- Use Prettier for automated code formatting.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines to run automated tests, linters, and performance checks.
- Ensure version control best practices are followed (e.g., commit messages, branching strategies).
