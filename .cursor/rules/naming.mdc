# Naming Conventions

## Component Files:

- Place all components in src/components and use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., new-component.tsx).
- Ensure filenames clearly reflect the componentâ€™s purpose and functionality.

## Directory Structure:

- Use lowercase names with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Maintain a consistent, predictable directory structure that scales as new features are added.

## Exports and Imports:

- Favor named exports to enable clear, auto-complete-friendly imports.
- Standardize import paths with aliases (if supported) to simplify navigation and refactoring.
