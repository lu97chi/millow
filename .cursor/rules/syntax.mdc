# Syntax and Formatting

## Function Declarations:

- Use the function keyword for defining pure functions to maintain clarity.
- Prefer arrow functions when they add clarity or are used as callbacks, but maintain consistency across the codebase.

## Conciseness in Conditionals:

- Avoid unnecessary curly braces for single-line conditionals; opt for clear, concise syntax.
- Leverage ternary operators judiciously for simple conditions, but avoid nesting them for readability.

## Declarative JSX:

- Write JSX in a declarative style, emphasizing what the UI should render.
- Keep component trees shallow by breaking down large components into smaller, focused pieces.

## Consistent Formatting:

- Use tools like Prettier to enforce a consistent code format.
- Establish team-wide formatting rules to reduce code review overhead and improve readability.
